        <h2>The Emu War</h2>
        <p>
          In 1932, during the Great Depression, farmers were growing more wheat
          to survive. This attracted more than 20,000 migrating emu birds to
          attack the farmlands for sustenance in the erratic Australian climate.
          You may be wondering how this led to a war. You see, the flock became
          so big that farmers had to ask the Ministry of Defence for help.
          Eventually, a small group of armed soldiers were sent to wipe out the
          birds with weapons. During this “mission,” hundreds of emu birds were
          killed at first, but their growing number, fast speed, and
          unpredictable movement made them difficult targets. That’s how
          Australia declared war on Emus and lost, making it one of the most
          funny historical events.

          <h2>The Death of Father Tragedy</h2>
          <p>
            Aeschylus, known as the father of tragedy in ancient Greece, met an
            extraordinary death. Tragedies from Greece and Rome often show
            characters facing death with an ironic twist of fate and this
            bizarre event is a testament to that. Legend has it that a tortoise
            fell from the sky after being dropped by an eagle. This eagle
            mistook Aeschylus’ bald head for a rock and dropped the tortoise
            intending to crack open its shell. Aeschylus’ unusual demise in 456
            B.C. is remembered as one of the most ironic deaths in history,
            particularly fitting for the father of tragedy renowned for
            exploring human fate and irony.

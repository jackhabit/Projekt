          <h2>The London Beer Flood</h2>
          <p>
            On October 17th, 1814, a tragic and bizarre industrial accident
            occurred at the Horse Shoe Brewery in St Giles, London. A massive
            22-foot high fermentation tank holding over 3,500 barrels of beer
            ruptured, releasing a 15-foot wave of beer onto the streets,
            flooding the slums around Tottenham Court Road. The beer wave
            swamped basements, collapsed buildings, and tragically killed at
            least 8 people. The disaster also led to hundreds of people drinking
            the spilled beer, with one more death reportedly caused by alcohol
            poisoning. Despite the brewery being taken to court, it was ruled an
            "Act of God" and the brewery wasn't held responsible. The event
            resulted in the replacement of wooden fermentation tanks with
            concrete vats in the brewing industry. The site of the brewery was
            eventually demolished in 1922, and the Dominion Theatre now sits
            partly on its location.

          <h2>The Strawhat Riots</h2>
          <p>
            In 1922, New York City saw one of the most crazy events in history
            known as the Straw Hat Riot. Although there was no weird law against
            it, back then wearing a straw hat after September 15th was
            considered to be a fashion crime. Those spotted wearing them would
            usually be ridiculed in public or have their hats knocked off their
            heads. This weird practice started when gangs started forcibly
            removing straw hats from people’s heads, as wearing them after
            mid-September was considered a breach of fashion decorum. People
            started taking it so seriously that it even sparked violent riots
            that lasted for days. While no deaths were reported, many people
            were injured and police had to eventually intervene to control the
            mayhem. All this over some straw hats! Prohibition in New York and
            the Straw Riots are events that happened at the same time.

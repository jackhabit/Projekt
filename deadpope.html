        <h2>The Trial of The Dead Pope</h2>
        <p>
          In 897, Pope Stephen VI called the corpse of Pope Formosus for trial
          instead of letting the poor guy rest in peace. This bizarre history
          event has often been referred to as “one of the grisliest occasions in
          papal history.” Pope Formosus had a history of going against court
          rules. Pope Stephen VI conducted a church council, which became known
          as the “Cadaver Synod.” He dug out the body of his predecessor, who
          had died six years earlier, and put him on trial for perjury and
          violating church law. Pope Formosus was found guilty, stripped of his
          papal title, and his body was thrown into the Tiber River.

          <h2>The Dancing Plague</h2>
          <p>
            In July 1518, a strange phenomenon started in Strasburg, Germany. A
            woman called Frau Troffea started dancing uncontrollably in the
            streets without any reason. More people joined her, and within a
            week, around 400 people were uncontrollably dancing in the streets,
            causing chaos. The people dancing seemed unable to stop. They danced
            constantly throughout the day and night, leading to some deaths from
            exhaustion or stroke. Doctors believed that the outbreak may have
            been caused by a combination of factors, including mass hysteria and
            a form of poisoning caused by a fungus that grows on rye. This
            bizarre event left historians confused, making it one of the most
            unusual events that can’t be explained.
